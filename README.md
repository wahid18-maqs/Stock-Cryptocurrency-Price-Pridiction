# Stock and Cryptocurrency Price Pridiction Web app

## Overview
The core of the project is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model, which is trained on past price data to make future price predictions. A Flask web application is built to allow users to input a stock or cryptocurrency symbol and a date range, and then see the predicted versus actual prices.

2.Prediction Result: Display of predicted vs actual prices along with the stock data.

3.Stock Data: Detailed view of the stock data in a scrollable table.

## Technologies Used
**1.Python:** Main programming language.
Jupyter Notebook: For developing and training the machine learning model.
Flask: Web framework for the web application.
yfinance: Library to fetch historical stock data.
Keras & TensorFlow: Libraries for building and training the LSTM model.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for plotting and visualizations.
HTML & CSS: For the front-end interface.
