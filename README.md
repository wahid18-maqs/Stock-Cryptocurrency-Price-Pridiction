# Stock and Cryptocurrency Price Pridiction Web app

## Overview
The core of the project is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model, which is trained on past price data to make future price predictions. A Flask web application is built to allow users to input a stock or cryptocurrency symbol and a date range, and then see the predicted versus actual prices.
